# Compiled
Contains versions of EclipseOS.

## Rolling Release Builds
These can come out very frequently. These are rolling release builds of EclipseOS, can be **VERY** broken and **VERY BUGGY**.

## Unstable Builds
These come out once in a while, they are better than Rolling Releases, less broken and buggy. But it can still be pretty unstable.

## Stable Builds
These are very rare to come out. Builds are made in here if they didn't pass Unstable levels. Can be very usable, but new bugs can always pop up out of nowhere.
If you find a bug, report it on our Issues page, or submit a Pull Request.
